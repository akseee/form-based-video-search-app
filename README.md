### posmotri_v_okno

In this project, I practiced working with partially completed modules. I styled existing plugins, modified themes created by other developers, added styles to already completed modules, and implemented working JavaScript code.

#### Features

**Dynamic Video Loading**
_Initial Load:_

- When the page loads, the script fetches data from an external source.
- It displays five video cards on the page.
- The first video's URL is set in the main video block.

_Load More Videos:_

- A button is provided to load additional video cards as needed.

**Interactive Video Switching**
_Card Click Event:_

- The script tracks clicks on video cards.
- The current video is switched based on the selected card.

**Form Submission Handling**
_Search and Update:_

- The script monitors form submissions.
- After submission, it searches the database for matches based on input parameters.
- The page is updated with the new data from the search results.

**Error and Loading States**
_Error Handling:_

- If an error occurs during data fetching, the video block is replaced with an error message block.
  _Loading Indicators:_
- Preloaders are displayed in the video and card blocks during data fetching to indicate that the process is ongoing.
